Beats all you've ever saw been in trouble with the law since the day they was born. The first mate and his Skipper too will do their very best to make the others comfortable in their tropic island nest? Didn't need no welfare states. Everybody pulled his weight.</p>

					<p class="info-content">Baby if you've ever wondered - wondered whatever became of me. I'm living on the air in Cincinnati. Cincinnati WKRP. Their house is a museum where people come to see 'em. They really are a scream the Addams Family? Sunny Days sweepin' the clouds away. On my way to where the air is sweet. Can you tell me how to get how to get to Sesame Street. I have always wanted to have a neighbor just like you. I've always wanted to live in a neighborhood with you. In 1972 a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit.</p>
					<p class="info-content">These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Believe it or not I'm walking on air. I never thought I could feel so free? Well we're movin' on up to the east side to a deluxe apartment in the sky. Why do we always come here? I guess well never know. Its like a kind of torture to have to watch the show!" It's a beautiful day in this neighborhood a beautiful day for a neighbor. Would you be mine? Could you be mine? Its a neighborly day in this beautywood a neighborly day for a beauty. Would you be mine? Could you be mine.</p>
